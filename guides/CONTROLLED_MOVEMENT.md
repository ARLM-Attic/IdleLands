# How to get around in IdleLands

_written by Yngvildr_

The first thing to realise about getting around is that really, you have no control. Everything is random, particularly where your adventurer "chooses" to walk.

Mostly, your adventurer will tend to keep walking in the direction they're already moving in (with something like a 75% chance). If they come to an obstacle (eg a wall) then they'll choose a new direction.

Every so often they'll randomly choose another direction for no reason at all. Usually when you're right near something you want to get to. Coz you know, it's funnier that way (ARGH!). I'm joking, it's actually completely random. Although it seems deliberate at times, it's not.

Needless to say, if you ever want to go anywhere in particular (eg a trainer, a boss, or a collectible), this can take a VERY long time.

Here's where the "Drunk" Personality comes in.

Enabling Drunk (which you'll get at level 18) full randomises your adventurer's walk. They'll stumble around like a very drunk person, constantly changing direction.

## How is this useful?

Well, let's assume you're walking in vaguely the right direction. As soon as your adventurer randomly takes off in the wrong direction, you can enable Drunk. (to see your Personalities on the map screen, toggle the option for this on the Settings page).

Once Drunk is on, your adventurer will randomly stumble around. Eventually, they'll go in (roughly) the right direction again, then you can quickly toggle it off, and they'll continue on their merry way.

Needless to say, this is VERY painstaking. It can take an excruciatingly long time to get anywhere, BUT, it is possible. So that's nice.

There are some definite tricks -

* Use Drunk as sparingly as possible. If your adventurer is about to hit a wall, they'll choose another direction anyway, so it seems to work better to leave Drunk off (this might be my crazed imagination clinging desperately to any possible sense of control).

* If you enable Drunk when you're against a wall, it means there's only 5 possible directions your adventurer can choose (sounds ridiculous, but it all helps).

* Enabling Drunk when you're in the middle of a large area of space gives your adventurer room to randomly wobble around for a bit before heading off in the right direction.

* Drunk has a slightly stronger likelihood to go backwards than forwards.

You'll learn the likely directions your adventurer will pick when they do hit an obstacle, depending on the direction of walk, and size & shape of the obstacle. If your adventurer is heading towards a wall on an angle, they'll *probably* slide along it in the same direction. Mostly. Maybe.

If you're walking straight into a wall, but you want to go back/left or back/right, it's best to turn Drunk on. Otherwise you'll probably just follow the wall in much the same direction.

You'll learn how to avoid going down stairs (by using "Scared Of The Dark") or going up stairs (using "Delver"). You can't avoid pits, or teleports. Sorry.

You'll learn patience. Oh, so much patience.

Mostly, you'll learn that really, IdleLands is an idle game. And it's random. Very, very random.

Don't panic. If you're frustrated, just remember, the god of IdleLands, The Mighty RNG (Random Number Generator), hates all of us randomly.


# Navigating in Parties
If you're in a party (you can see if you are, on the lower left hand side of the Overview page), then the leader is the person at the top of that party list. The leader decides where the party will go, everyone else just automatically follows along.

The leader can therefore use drunk walking (as above) to guide the entire party to a specific adventure, if they're above level 18. And very patient.

If the leader leaves the party, then the party will disband. If the leader leaves IdleLands (by logout, or if their connection is broken for more than a minute) then the next person becomes the leader, and so on down the list.

If you're in the party, you can switch on the "Scared Of The Dark" or "Delver" personalities to stop you from going down into a dungeon or upstairs out of one. If you do this, you won't follow the leader down (or up) stairs, but you will still fight any battles that the party has. Once you're separated from your party, you can "control" your adventurer like usual. Ie, not much, but hey, it's funny.

You have to be on the same map as the other adventurers to join a party with them. Which means if you're in a dungeon and your party breaks up, you likely won't join another until you get out of the dungeon.

When you join a party, you will be auto-teleported to where the leader is. This is unavoidable.
