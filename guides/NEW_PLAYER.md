# How To Play IdleLands

In a way, you don't. There are many idle games. This one is VERY idle.

At the start, there is very little to do, other than watch your adventurer move around the map, and talk in Chat (we're very friendly, don't be afraid). That's ok, it picks up pretty quickly.

At the top of the screen you'll see the Overview (where most action happens), Equipment, Map, Achievements, Settings etc.

As the game progresses, you will have choices to make, mostly in the Choice Log (right hand side) in the Overview, but also a few personality choices in Settings.

## Things You Can Do
• You will randomly join parties with up to 3 other players. You'll be able to choose to leave these parties
• You will occasionally be offered a new class
• Mostly, you will occasionally receive new gear. You don't have to wear this, if it doesn't suit your taste/class
• Under Settings, later on you will be able to choose Personalities (as you gain them). These will give you options like "gain more XP and less gold" or "Don't go down stairs" etc. These will affect how your adventurer behaves.
• Much later on you will be able to assign yourself a title, such as "the Effective" or "the Golden Child". You can see more of these titles on the other players in Chat.

## Things That Can Happen
• You will be offered gear upgrades (and downgrades)
• Your adventurer will explore the many mysterious lands and go on adventures (you know, like adventurers are supposed to!)
• You will lose many fights, and maybe win some (it's ok, winning or losing doesn't really matter too much, and taking damage even helps, eg by increasing your ranking in the Sponge Achievement, which increases your CON thus improving your Hit Points)
• You will gain gold
• You will lose gold
• You will generally wonder what to do your mostly increasing pile of gold (it's ok, you'll be offered gear you can buy)
• You will gradually level up, as you explore the world, get in fights and have experiences
• You'll be able to watch (and laugh) at the many random and ridiculous troubles your adventurer will stumble into

## How Stats Are Used
• HP Hit Points - How much damage you can can take before you lose (don't worry, you never really die)
• MP Mana Points - A resource used to cast spells
• STR Strength - How good you are at hitting things (mostly if you're a tank class like Fighter and Barbarian)
• CON Constitution - Increases your HP
• DEX Dexterity - Helps you hit
• AGI Agility - How good you are at avoiding getting hit
• INT Intelligence - Increases your MP and increases spell damage
• LUK Luck - How lucky you are (in battles, in life)
